My personal coding blog attempt. Jekyll powered and GitHub Pages hosted. Visit [http://mokacoding.com](mokacoding.com).

####Note to self

To run locally use `jekyll serve -w -b ''`.

###TODO

* A better style for the coding blocks.
* Credits for the layout, as I basically copied it from a Tumblr theme.
* Add an about
* Categories
* Responsive Layout!
