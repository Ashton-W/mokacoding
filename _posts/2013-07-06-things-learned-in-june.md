Last month I decided to start keeping track of the things learned along the way. This list at the moment seems kinda short, let's say that's because I didn't start keeping track of the stuff from the beginning of the month.

**Coding**

Testing Objective-C classes equality: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10944460/testing-class-equality-in-objective-c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10944460/testing-class-equality-in-objective-c)

Objective-C <code>_cmd</code> returns the method name within a method: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2770307/nslog-the-method-name-with-objective-c-in-iphone](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2770307/nslog-the-method-name-with-objective-c-in-iphone)

You can use a Pod locally: [https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Working-on-a-pod](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Working-on-a-pod)

**Trivia**

Where does the Logarithm name come from:
"Napier first called <i>L</i> an "artificial number", but later introduced the word <i>"logarithm"</i> to mean a number that indicates a ratio: λόγος (<i>logos</i>) meaning proportion, and ἀριθμός (<i>arithmos</i>) meaning number." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm</a>
